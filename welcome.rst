Welcome!
========

1. Learning goals
-----------------

For you:

* get a first (or second) look at tools;
* gain some experience in the basic command line;
* get 80% of way to a complete analysis of some data;
* introduction to philosophy and perspective of data analysis in science;

2. Safe space and code of conduct
---------------------------------

This is intended to be a safe and friendly place for learning!

Please see the Software Carpentry workshop Code of Conduct: http://software-carpentry.org/conduct.html

In particular, please ask questions, because I guarantee you that your
question will help others!

3. Instructor introductions
---------------------------

Titus Brown - prof at UC Davis in the School of Vet Med.

Phil Brooks - postdoc at UC Davis.

4. Amazon and cloud computing - why?!
-------------------------------------

* simplifies software installation;
* can be used for bigger analyses quite easily;
* good for "burst" capacity (just got a data set!)
* accessible everywhere;

5. Sticky notes and how they work... + Minute Cards
---------------------------------------------------

Basic rules:

* no sticky note - "working on it"
* green sticky note - "all is well"
* red sticky note - "need help!"

Place the sticky notes where we can see them from the back of the room --
e.g. on the back of your laptop.

At the end of each session (coffee break, lunch, end of day) please
write down on an index card **one thing you learned** and **one thing
you're still confused about.**

Logging in to your Amazon instance.
===================================

We've spun up cloud machines and installed a bunch of software for you
(see :doc:`install` for what, exactly).  All you need to do is log in!

So,

1. Find and start the terminal.

2. Copy your hostname from the list that we sent around.

3. Type 'ssh ubuntu@HOSTNAME', pasting in the hostname (set of four . separated numbers) in place of HOSTNAME.

4. Type in the super-secret password that we'll give you.

Done!
